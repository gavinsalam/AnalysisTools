# Towards 1.2.0

## New features in C++

- histogram objects in AnalysisBase now have a declare_once() method,
  which allows for usage such as `hists["some_name"].declare_once(binning).add_entry(value, weight);`

- AnalysisBase provides a `-git-info [yes|no]` option to control whether git info is
  determined at run time (default on, turn it off on systems where git would be slow)

## New features in Python (still in development)

- hfile.Histogram objects, which accommodate various kinds of histogram and know how to plot themselves

- hfile.HFile to read in a whole file, providing a list of hfile.Histogram objects

- new python/view-hfile.py script, relying on the above, to plot all histograms from a file

- hfile.ValueAndError objects now acquire a label (which can be set
  manually or automatically) and which is used for checking whether two
  objects being combined are correlated


## Other changes

- scripts/combine-runs.pl now tries to check for identical lines between
  successive files and issues a warning if for each line it finds at
  least one repetition across successive files.

- SimpleHistWithError how has methods set_n_for_error(...) and
  n_for_error(), with the error calculation now using the value from
  set_n_for_error() if it is > 0; the output of AnalysisBase now
  sets n_for_error to effective_iev_attempts() SimpleHistWithError objects.


## Bug fixes
- averages[...].set_ref(xsc_label) was being ignored if the average was being
  filled with add_entry(value,weight); that's now fixed
